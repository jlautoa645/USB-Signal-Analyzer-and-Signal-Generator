# USB-Signal-Analyzer-and-Signal-Generator

This repository contains all documentation regarding the USB Signal Analyzer and Signal Generator that I designed using Altium Designer. The project is based off of a similar board designed by Phillip Salmony in his 'Mixed-Signal Hardware Design with KiCAD' course. Details of the course are available here: https://www.phils-lab.net/courses
